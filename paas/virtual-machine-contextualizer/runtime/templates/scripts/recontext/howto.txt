Requires FUSE and Python bindings

To start:
    python ffs.py <mount point>

To start with printouts from FSS showing:
    python ffs.py -f <mount point>

To stop:
    fusermount -u <mount point>

To force stop:
    fusermount -z -u <mount point>

The restartFFS.sh script attempts to remove previous mounts and then start a new run with printouts.
