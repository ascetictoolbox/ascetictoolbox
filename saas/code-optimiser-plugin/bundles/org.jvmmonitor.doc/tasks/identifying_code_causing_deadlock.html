<h1>
    Identifying the code causing deadlock
</h1>
<p>
    When monitoring a JVM, deadlock is automatically detected and you can find out which threads are involved in deadlock.
</p>
<p>
    To identify the code causing deadlock:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Search the threads that has the state <b>DEADLOCKED</b> at <b>State</b> column. 
    If there are many threads, you may click the header of State column to sort threads,
    or type the filter text "DEADLOCKED" at filter.
    </li>
    <li>
    Look at <b>Lock</b> column and <b>Lock Owner</b> column to find out the lock object 
    and its owner thread for each locked thread.
    </li>
    <li>
    Select the deadlocked thread so that its stack traces are shown on right hand side, 
    and find out which methods are being invoked.
    </li>
    <li>
    Double-click the method in stack traces to check the code on Java editor.
    </li>
</ol>
