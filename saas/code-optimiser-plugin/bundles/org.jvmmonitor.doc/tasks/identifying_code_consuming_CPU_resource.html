    Identifying the code consuming CPU resource
</h1>
<p>
    When you notice that CPU is unexpectedly overloaded (e.g. when monitoring CPU usage at Timeline page), 
    you may want to identify which part of code is actually consuming CPU resource.
</p>
<p>
    To identify the code consuming CPU resource:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Click the header of <b>CPU</b> column at threads table to sort.
    </li>
    <li>
    Select the thread that has high load of CPU so that its stack traces are shown on right hand side,
    and find out which methods are being invoked.
    </li>
    <li>
    Double-click the method in stack traces to check the code on Java editor.
    </li>
</ol>

    [<img src="./img/refresh.gif" style="vertical-align: middle"/>] at the local toolbar to disable refresh. 
    Alternatively, you can change the period to update on preference page
