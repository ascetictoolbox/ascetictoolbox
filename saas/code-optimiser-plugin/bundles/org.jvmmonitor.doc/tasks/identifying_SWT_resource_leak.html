<h1>
    Identifying SWT resource leak
</h1>

<p>
    When your Java application is based on SWT, you may want to check if there are any operating system
    resource leak that can be caused by missing invocation of <code>org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Resource.dispose()</code>. 
</p>
<p>
    To identify SWT resource leak:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Open <b>SWT Resources page</b> that is available in case of monitoring SWT-based Java application.
    On the left hand side, you can see SWT resources that have been allocated after connecting to JVM.
    When you select one of SWT resources, you can see its stack trace on the right hand side,
    so that you can identify the source code in which the SWT resource was allocated.

    </li>
    <li>
    Press <b>Clear</b> button
    [<img src="./img/clear_co.gif" style="vertical-align: middle"/>] at the local toolbar to clear the 
    currently shown resources. 
    <p><b>Node:</b> Clear button doesn't dispose SWT resources in JVM, but just makes the
    currently shown resources invisible.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    Do some operations in which you suspect resource leak. Typically, it would be a set of operations
    that finally go back to the initial state of operations (e.g. opening a view and closing a view).
    You will see the resources that are newly allocated but not displosed.
    </li>
</ol>
