<h1>
    Analyzing call tree
</h1>

<p>
    To analyze call tree:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Make sure that <b>Call Tree</b> page is opened showing a list of threads. 
    The total time of method invocation is shown at <b>Time (ms)</b> column for each thread.
    </li>
    <li>
    Expand a thread node to see the methods call tree.
    </li>
    <li>
    Search the method node that has relatively large value of self invocation time shown
    at <b>Self Time (ms)</b> or <b>Self Time (%)</b> column.
    The self invocation time means the invocation time without taking the invocation time 
    of callees into account.
    To find such method that is likely bottleneck of perfornamce, 
    you may repeat expanding the method node that has relatively large value of 
    total invocation time shown at <b>Time (ms)</b> column.
    </li>
    <li>
    Double-click the method node to check the code on Java editor. To improve the performance,
    one direction is to reduce the self invocation time per invocation, and the other direction
    is to reduce the invocation count. The invocation count is shown at <b>Count</b> column.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> If you select the method node and select the context menu <b>Focus On '&lt;method name&gt;'</b>, 
    the selected method node becomes the root node and 
    Time (%) and Self Time (%) are re-calulated with only the focused method and its callees,
    so that you can focus on the area of interest.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Note:</b> When selecting multiple method nodes, 
    the sum of self invocation time of selected methods are shown at status line at bottom of Eclipse window.
