<h1>
    Identifying the objects consuming heap memory
</h1>
<p>
    When you notice that the heap memory is unexpectedly consumed 
    (e.g. when monitoring used heap memory at Timeline page),
    you may want to identify which objects are actually consuming heap memory.
</p>
<p>
    To identify the objects consuming heap memory:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Make sure that the heap histogram is sorted by <b>Size</b> column, 
    and see the consumed heap memory size for each class.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are interested in which objects are being increased during a certain duration, 
    press <b>Clear Delta</b> button
    [<img src="./img/clear_co.gif" style="vertical-align: middle"/>] at the local toolbar to clear delta size, 
    and sort with <b>Delta</b> column.
    </li>
    <li>
    Double-click the class to check the code on Java editor as needed.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    <b>Note:</b> If the refresh is too fast to see the content, unselect <b>Refresh</b> toggle button 
    [<img src="./img/refresh.gif" style="vertical-align: middle"/>] at the local toolbar to disable refresh. 
    Alternatively, you can change the period to update on preference page 
    <b>Window > Preferences > Java > Monitor > Period to update</b>.
