<h1>
    Analyzing callers/callees
</h1>
<p>
    You may want to find callers and callees of a certain method in some cases. 
    For example, when you look at Hot Spots page, and find out that a certain method has relatively large value 
    of invocation count, you may want to find its callers. 
    Note that there can be other places that the same method is called in the call tree.
</p>
<p>
    To analyze callers/callees:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    Select a method on Call Tree page or Hot Spots page, and select the context menu <b>Show Callers/Callees</b>
    to show the callers and callees of the selected method on <b>Callers/Callees</b> page.
    </li>
    <li>
    Double-click the method to check the code on Java editor as needed.
    </li>
</ol>
