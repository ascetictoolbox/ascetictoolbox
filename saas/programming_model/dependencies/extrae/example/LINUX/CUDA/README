To execute this simple hello world test just,

  a) make the binary issuing "make"

  and then

  b) execute the run-instrumented.sh command for non dyninst-based installations or run-dyninst.sh for dyninst-based installations.

The latter command will run the application and merge the resulting intermediate tracefiles into a single Paraver tracefile.
