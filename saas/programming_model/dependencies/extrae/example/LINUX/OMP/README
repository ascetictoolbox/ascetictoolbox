If you have installed Extrae with DynInst support you can use automatic instrumentation of uninstrumented binaries as shown in the script:

  run_dyninst.sh

Otherwise, you can dynamically preload the tracing library by defining the environment variable LD_PRELOAD as shown in the script:

  run_ldpreload.sh

Also, you can manually instrument the source code (i.e., adding calls to Extrae_init and Extrae_fini) and statically link with the tracing library and run the application like in:

  run_instrumented.sh
