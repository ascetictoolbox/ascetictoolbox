There are two basic examples, on written in C (stored in C/) and another one written in C++ (stored in C++/). Both examples are written so that a GPU as a accelerator. If you want to change this, just go into the source code and change #define DEVICE CL_DEVICE_TYPE_GPU into #define DEVICE CL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU.

The instrumentation steps are the same despite the version you choose. Just enter the directory you prefer, and then type
  make
to compile the application. Then enter in your command line
  ./trace.sh ./vadd
to execute and instrument the application.
