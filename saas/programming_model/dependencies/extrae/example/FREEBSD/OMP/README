If you have installed Extrae with DynInst support you can use automatic instrumentation of uninstrumented binaries as shown in the script

  run_dyninst.sh

Otherwise, you need some code modifications (i.e., adding Extrae_init and Extrae_fini calls) and run the application like in

  run_ldpreload.sh
