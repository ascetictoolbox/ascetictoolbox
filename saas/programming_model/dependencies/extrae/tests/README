Here will go all the strange tests (required) by some machines.

Information of each directory:

sizeof -> check empirically the size of each type required in configure.ac.
          This is usually done by configure, but cross-compiling does not 
          allow AC_CHECK_SIZEOF.
          Machines that may use this test : BG/L, NEC-SX?

event  -> check the size of the event_t structure.
          Use this test to know how many bytes are occupied by an event.

mpi-characteristics -> Tests executed on BG/L to gather MPI + HWC information
