Package dependencies (and comments)
--
* libxml2 (>=2.5.0) 
  http://www.xmlsoft.org (or look for libxml2-dev or libxml2-devel packages for your OS)
  Parse XML configuration files (optional)

  libxml2 is used to parse the configuration of the instrumentation package. It is highly recommendable because the XML configuration file is more flexible than using environment variables.

* PAPI
  http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi
  access to HW counters (optional)

  The HW counters within the microprocessor increases the richness of the gathered traces. It is highly recommendable to install and use PAPI with extrae, although on some old kernels may require kernel patching.

* DynInst
  http://www.dyninst.org
  support dynamic instrumentation (optional)

  This is in experimental status. It is known to work on linux PPC32/64 systems and some minor testing has been done in linux x86/x86-64 systems.

* libunwind (>=1.0)
  http://www.nongnu.org/libunwind
  access to callstack (suggested for intel ia64 and intel x86 32 & 64 bits)

  This library is used to access the callstack within extrae. Accessing the callstack lets the analyst gather MPI call-sites and emit information on manually added events. It is required for intel x86-64 and ia64 architectures.

* liberty and libbfd (from binutils package)
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/binutils
  access debugging binary information (optional).

  These two libraries are required to translate gathered application addresses into source code information (like file name, address line and function name). It is highly recommendable.

* libz
  http://www.zlib.net
  deal with compressed z files

  liberty and libbfd may need libz (optional). Also libz may be used to generate .prv.gz files directly (optional).

* MPI
  execute MPI jobs (optional) - tested with MPICH, MPICH2 and OpenMPI. Others may work.

* OpenMP runtime (gcc, ibm or icc)
  execute OpenMP jobs (optional).

* CUDA / CUPTI
  execute CUDA-based applications

* OpenCL
  execute OpenCL-based applications


Please, make sure to install the development versions of these packages (-dev, -devel) when available.
