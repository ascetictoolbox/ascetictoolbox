 COMP SUPERSCALAR FRAMEWORK
-----------------------------

COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming model which aims to ease the development of applications for distributed infrastructures, such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds. COMP superscalar also features a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism of applications at execution time.



Release number 1.1.1
Release date: 30-Jul-2013 
-------------------------

This is the first public release of the COMP Superscalar Framework.

Implemented features:
	* Orchestration Element(OE) automatic instrumentation
		- task creations
		- data syncronizations
		- runtime system start and stop
	* Supported Core Element (CE) types:
		- regular methods
		- SOAP webservices (stateless and stateful)
	* CE constraints definition mechanism
	* Multi-OE support	
	* Data version management
	* Data dependency between tasks detection due to objects or files accessed
	* Data dependency representation using a directed aciclic graph 
	* Task scheduling algorithm based on the estimated execution time and data locality
	* Transparent data management
	* Job submission to resources
	* Resource interoperability through JavaGAT
		- SSH
		- Grid middlewares: GLite, Globus toolkit
		- Microsoft Azure
	* Exploit Cloud's scalability and elasticity
		- Emotive
		- Amazon EC2
		- ROCCI
		- OpenNebula
	* Shared Disks support
	* Detection and deletion of obsolete intermediate files 
	* Execution progress information:
		- runtime log
		- resource usage
		- web-based interface
	* Support for traces

Bugfixes:

Known limitations:
	- No data replicas deletion mechanism
	- Single master.
	- Only SOAP webservices implementing the WS-Interoperability standard are supported as Service CEs.

Release number 1.1.2
Release date: 28-Apr-2014
-------------------------

Implemented features:
 * C/C++ binding.
 * Python binding.
 * Integrated Development Environment for COMPSs applications (IDE)
 * Priority tasks.
 * New tracing system using the Extrae tool.
 * Deleting a file within an OE removes all the replicas in the system.
 * Updated the SSH Trilead adaptor libraries to remove unnecessary sleeps.
 * Scripts for submission to queue systems (LSF, PBS, Slurm).
 * Configuration of application directory and library path in project XML file.
 * Separate logs for resubmitted / rescheduled tasks.
 * Create a COMPSs sandbox in the workers instead of JavaGAT's

-------------------------------

Release number 1.2
Release date: Nov-2014 
-------------------------

Implemented features:
 * N implementations for task methods, each with its own constraints.
 * Constraint-aware resource management.
 * Support for multicore tasks.
 * Pluggable schedulers: facilitate the addition of new schedulers and policies.
 * Extended support for objects in C/C++ binding.
 * Extended IDE for N implementations and deployment through PMES.
 * Update cloud connector for rOCCI to work with rocci-cli v4.2.5.
 * Enhance rOCCI connector to compute the real VM creation times.
 * Extended resources schema to support Virtual Appliances pricing.

 * New LSF GAT adaptor.

 * Deprecated Azure and EMOTIVE Cloud connectors.
 * Deprecated Azure GAT adaptor.
