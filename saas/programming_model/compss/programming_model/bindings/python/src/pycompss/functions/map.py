        If additional iterable arguments are passed, function must take that many arguments

        shorter than another it is assumed to be extended with None items. If function is
        None, the identity function is assumed; if there are multiple arguments, map()

        iterables (a kind of transpose operation). The iterable arguments may be a sequence
        or any iterable object; the result is always a list.
