=============================
 COMP SUPERSCALAR FRAMEWORK
=============================

COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming model which aims to ease the development of applications for distributed infrastructures,
such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds. COMP superscalar also features a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism of 
applications at execution time.
