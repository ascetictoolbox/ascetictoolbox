If you have installed Extrae with DynInst support you can use automatic instrumentation of uninstrumented binaries as shown in the script

  run_dyninst.sh

When using DynInst-based instrumentation you can easily add instrumentation to the application. In the XML configuration file there is a reference to function-list file that points to routines within the application to be instrumented.

If you don't use DynInst-based instrumentation, you need some code modifications (i.e., adding Extrae_init and Extrae_fini calls) and run the application like in

  run_static.sh
