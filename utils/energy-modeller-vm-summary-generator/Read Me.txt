The aim of this tool is to log out to disk: 	*	The average power consumption of a VM	* 	The energy consumption of a VM	It utilises a comma seperated file called vm_experimental_list.csv, that has the VM id and vm name, of the VMs that are to be reported upon.To get this information run the following query on the Zabbix database:mysql -u ascetic-em -D ascetic-em -p -e"SELECT vm_measurement.vm_id, vm_name, min(clock) AS start, max(clock) AS end FROM vm_measurement, vm WHERE vm.vm_id = vm_measurement.vm_id GROUP BY vm_id;" > vm_experimental_list.txtTruncate this list to the set of VMs that belong to the experiment.Then insert into the file "energymodeller_summary_generator.properties" the start and end time of the experiment your wish to gathr data for.Finally run the program and the output will be written to the standard out.It should output : vm id, vm name, average power used, total energy used and duration
