      This is the java binding to the libvirt library.

To use it, your program needs to access both the java library (.jar file),
and the JNA library (.jar file)

1. This version of the java mappings is designed to work with a 
a minimum libvirt version of 0.9.12

2. You must have the libvirt.jar file in your classpath.
By default the installs it to /usr/share/java/0.4.9.jar

3. See the INSTALL file for instructions on building locally.

4. You can run the unit tests with ant test.

5. There is a rudimentary functional test program that the libvirt-java-devel
installs put it into /usr/share/doc/libvirt-java-devel-0.4.9/test.java

    To run it, first copy the test.java file to writeable directory
    cp /usr/share/doc/libvirt-java-devel-0.4.9/test.java ~

    Compile the java file to a class:
    javac -classpath /usr/share/java/libvirt-0.4.9.jar test.java

    Then run the program:
    java -classpath .:/usr/share/java/jna.jar:/usr/share/java/libvirt-0.4.9.jar test

6. There is full javadoc for the API in /usr/share/javadoc/libvirt-java-0.4.9/

7. The full API can be found at http://www.libvirt.org/html/libvirt-libvirt.html
