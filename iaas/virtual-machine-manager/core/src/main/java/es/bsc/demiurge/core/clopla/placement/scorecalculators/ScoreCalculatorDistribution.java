/**
 * This class defines the score used in the distribution policy.
 * The score in this case contains 1 hard score and 3 levels of soft scores.
 * Hard score: overcapacity of the servers of the cluster 
 *             plus number of fixed VMs that were moved. (minimize)
 * Soft scores: 1) Number of hosts that are not idle. (maximize)
 *              2) std dev of the avg cpus_assigned/cpus_total in the hosts of the cluster. (minimize)
 *              3) Number of migrations needed from initial state (minimize)
