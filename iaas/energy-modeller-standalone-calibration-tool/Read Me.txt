The standalone calibration tool is designed to calibrate the model that is used for physical hosts. Its usage is as follows: 

java –jar energy-modeller-standalone-calibration-tool-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar <hostname> [halt-on-calibrated] [benchmark-only] [use-watts-up-meter]

<hostname>: This is an non-optional argument that states which host to emulate the Watt meter for. If no hostname is specified the tool will work for all calibrated hosts.

[halt-on-calibrated]: The halt-on-calibrated flag will prevent calibration in cases where the data has already been gathered.

[benchmark-only]: The benchmark-only flag skips the calibration run and performs a benchmark run only.

[use-watts-up-meter]: The use-watts-up-meter flag can be used so that Zabbix is not used for calibration but local measurements are performed instead. This requires a Watts Up Meter.
