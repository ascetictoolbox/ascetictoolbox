The VM Manager is still not ready to be used in the TUB testbed. I have only tested it on a private BSC cluster.
In order to use the VM Manager from other components, you can use the REST+JSON interface that we have defined.
You can find the API description here: http://docs.asceticvmmanager.apiary.io/
